## Description

### Intro

Unlocking Sales Potential with Human Features Presence Analysis.

The primary goal of this project is to develop a tool, utilizing Machine Learning (ML), too
assist the sales/marketing and studio departments at Parfois. This tool will offer a clear overview
of the presence of human models for different products on your website, ultimately allowing informed
decision-making.

### Targets

#### Studio Department

To be used by the studio department as a classification tool and product references check in the production stage. 

#### Sales Team

Combining this tool with their sales performance information, will be possible for Parfois to have actionable insights into the impact of products with models on website sales through a cutting-edge Machine Learning (ML) tool.

## Installation
### First Section:

The repository is divided into two sections. First will be every file outside the app_launcher folder. It contains all the code inside the app itself, explanations, and comments on the results. There is a requirements.txt file. 

### Parfois_app:

In the parfois_app folder, you have a requirements.txt file and can run the parfois_app.py. On the dash page you have all the info needed.

## Usage
### Parfois Studio
The Parfois studio works in the following manner:
There's a list of product references to be photographed, and that list is managed by the Sample Coordinator. After defining the shooting schedule and the 3 possible categories for the product photos (with a human model, with a human model but with no recognition, and only product), the Sample Coordinator gives the output to the shooting team on the task board.
While the shooting is taking place, and again, after all the photos are taken, the Sample Coordinator needs to individually check all photos taken and all the references in a Studio Folder, manually checking the workflow of the shooting.
#### No more. 
They can just run the parfois_app in the Studio Folder, and a manual work that can take hours is reduced to minutes. 

### Parfois Sales Team

By not having a record of what reference has a human model or not, and if/when that product on the website has changed its category (from only product to no recognition), the sales team has no input on how the pretense of a human model can impact the sales performance of a product or category of products. We need to keep in mind that a model for a no-recognition kind of photos can cost around €400/day, and a model for full body and face shooting can go up to €5.000 and more.

We can see the potential for cost reduction here.
